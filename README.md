#   My First Portfolio Project

This project's goal was to make a website to show off my other projects and website design. I used html, css, and javascript for this project. It was a good experience in incorporating js into a website so I could show off my Mixed-Messages project. I will be updating this continuously through my full-stack schooling. 

##  How to use

I encourage you to check my website out [here](https://gu1ll0t1n3.github.io/Portfolio/)!
Let me know any compliments/criticism you have about it.

##  Credits

I'd like to shout out the [Magic: The Gathering Fandom wiki](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) for being a big help with research through this project and the Mixed-Messages project.
